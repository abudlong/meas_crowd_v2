    A badly fitted source (local chi2/px >= ``ellipChi2Min``, S/N between ``ellipMinSnr`` and
    ``brightCorrSigma``) and the points within ``ellipGroupFwhm`` FWHM (at most one Gaia
    source) are refitted with alternative models: 'one' (one extended source replaces all of
    them) and 'star+gal' (the Gaia source stays a point, one extended source replaces the
    others), each with a Gaussian or exponential elliptical profile convolved with the PSF.  The
    best model, penalised by 5 per extra fitted number, must beat the point sources by at least
    ``ellipDchi2``.

    psfPeak : `float`
        Peak value of the unit-flux PSF.
    noise : `float`
        Typical pixel noise.
    badBitmask : `int`
        Mask bits of pixels to ignore.
    fitkw : `dict`
        Keyword arguments of the joint fit.
    psfSigma : `float`
        PSF sigma [px].
    verboseEllip : `bool`, optional
        Print every model tried.
    only : `list` [`int`], optional
        Only try these source indices.
    explain : `bool`, optional
        Print why sources are not tried, and tracebacks of failed fits.

    Returns
    -------
    S : `dict`
        Source state with the extended sources.
    fit : `dict`
        Joint fit.
    n_tried : `int`
        Number of sources tried.

    lobes, spikes wider than ~2 px) survives; pixel-scale defects do not.

    For every source within ``withinFwhm`` FWHM of a star at least ``fluxRatio`` times brighter

    at control positions at the same distance from the bright star, rotated in 45-degree steps.
    A mismatch pattern of the bright star (rings, spikes, lobes) puts similar flux at several
