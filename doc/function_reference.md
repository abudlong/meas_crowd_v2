# meas_crowd: function reference

Every public function and class of `lsst.meas.crowd`: what it does, its parameters (with types and defaults) and what it returns.  Generated from the docstrings by `doc/make_function_reference.py`; do not edit by hand (run `python doc/make_function_reference.py` after changing a docstring).  How the pipeline fits together is in [pipeline_guide.md](pipeline_guide.md); the output catalogue in [catalog_columns.md](catalog_columns.md).

189 functions and 5 classes in 13 modules.  Everything listed here can be used as `crowd.<name>` after `import lsst.meas.crowd as crowd`, or from its module (`from lsst.meas.crowd import photometry`).  Names starting with `_` are internal helpers and are not listed.

Fit local correction terms for every bright or saturated star.

On top of the joint model, within ``radiusFwhm`` FWHM, each bright star's residual is fitted with ``amp * (a*P + bx*dP/dx + by*dP/dy + cxx*d2P/dx2 + cyy*d2P/dy2 + cxy*d2P/dxdy)`` (flux, position, size and ellipticity), optional radial rings with angular modes (halo and wing structure) and optional narrow core terms (core sharper than the PSF, possibly off-centre).

The correction image does not depend on the flux the basis was built with; the reported flux, shift and percentage are rescaled to the current flux. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

A badly fitted source (local chi2/px >= ``ellipChi2Min``, S/N between ``ellipMinSnr`` and ``brightCorrSigma``) and the points within ``ellipGroupFwhm`` FWHM (at most one Gaia source) are refitted with alternative models: 'one' (one extended source replaces all of them) and 'star+gal' (the Gaia source stays a point, one extended source replaces the others), each with a Gaussian or exponential elliptical profile convolved with the PSF.

Run one outer pass of the adaptive pipeline.

A warm fit of the current sources (Gaia starting positions or the previous pass), then detect -> add -> joint fit -> refine -> clean, repeated until the residual check says stop; then the halo, ring, position-polish, pair-split and galaxy tests.

### pipeline.psfStarImage

`psfStarImage(exposure, fit, idx)`

Return the image with every source's model subtracted except the PSF stars ``idx``.

Each PSF star is left alone on (data - neighbours' models): the input for a standard PSF determiner in a crowded field.  The joint fit's own model is used (without the bright-star correction terms, which describe the PSF mismatch the new PSF should capture).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The fitted exposure (not changed). |
| `fit` | `dict` | Joint fit (`fitLib.jointPsfFitDiag`) of that exposure. |

### pipeline.refitPsfPiff

`refitPsfPiff(exposure, psf, res, P, point, verbose=True)`

Refit the PSF with PIFF (the Rubin pipelines' PSF determiner) on neighbour-subtracted stars.

The clean PSF stars of the pass (`selectPsfStars`) are left alone on an image with every other source's model subtracted (`psfStarImage`), turned into PSF candidates at their fitted positions (``MakePsfCandidatesTask``) and handed to ``PiffPsfDeterminerTask`` (``lsst.meas.extensions.piff``).  The wings beyond PIFF's stamp and the regularisation are applied afterwards, as for the other refits.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | The pass's PSF. |

### pipeline.refinePsfMedian

`refinePsfMedian(exposure, psf, res, badBitmask, P, fitkw, fit0=None, verbose=True)`

Correct the PSF core with the median residual/flux of the bright clean stars.

The median is robust to neighbours, cosmic rays and per-star noise, so it keeps the shape error shared by the bright stars.  Applied within ``psfCoreRadiusFwhm`` FWHM (cosine taper), soft-thresholded, smoothed and cross-validated on two halves of the stars.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The fitted exposure. |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | Current PSF. |

### pipeline.smoothPsfKernel

`smoothPsfKernel(kernel, fwhm, coreFwhm=1.5, sigma=1.0, maxPattern=1.5)`

Return a hole-free, smooth version of a PSF kernel.

Inside ``coreFwhm`` FWHM the kernel is kept.  Outside it is rebuilt as ``radial profile(r) * exp(angular pattern)``: the profile is the median of each 1-px ring (so a few holed pixels cannot pull it down), forced to decrease outwards; the pattern is ``log(kernel / profile)`` median-filtered over 5x5 px (removes isolated holes and hot pixels), smoothed by ``sigma`` px and clipped to +-``maxPattern``.  Smooth structure (ellipticity, lobes, spikes wider than ~2 px) survives; pixel-scale defects do not.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kernel` | `numpy.ndarray` | PSF kernel (odd size, centred). |

| `point` | `lsst.geom.Point2D` | Position at which the kernel is taken. |

| `verbose` | `bool`, optional | Print how much flux moved. |
| `label` | `str`, optional | Suffix for the printed line. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | The regularised (constant) PSF, or the input PSF. |

### pipeline.extendPsfWingsKeep

`extendPsfWingsKeep(psf, point, size=81, blend=(12.0, 16.0), keepAngular=False, verbose=True)`

Extend a PSF with a Moffat tail, optionally keeping its angular structure.

Like `fitLib.extendPsfWings`, but with ``keepAngular`` only the kernel's azimuthal mean is replaced by the Moffat beyond the blend radius, so spikes and other non-circular structure are kept.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | PSF. |
| `point` | `lsst.geom.Point2D` | Position at which the kernel is taken. |

### pipeline.wingProfilePsf

`wingProfilePsf(exposure, res, psf, P, verbose=True)`

Return a PSF whose outer wings are measured from the stars.

Neighbour-subtracted radial profiles of unsaturated bright stars (peak S/N >= ``wingMinSnr``), divided by their flux, give the normalised profile where they have signal; saturated stars are scaled to it where both are measured and extend it outwards.  A Moffat fitted to the combined profile replaces the kernel beyond ``wingBlendFwhm``.  Degenerate fits are rejected.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The fitted exposure. |
| `res` | `dict` | Result of `runInnerAdaptive`. |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | Current PSF. |
| `P` | `dict` | Pipeline options (``wing_*``, ``psfWingSize``). |
| `verbose` | `bool`, optional | Print the fitted profile. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` or `None` | The new PSF, or None if there are too few stars or the fit is degenerate. |

`spatialKernelPsf(K0, Kx, Ky, xc, yc, scale)`

Build a linearly varying LSST PSF.

``K(x, y) = K0 + (x - xc)/scale * Kx + (y - yc)/scale * Ky``, as a LinearCombinationKernel with linear spatial functions (the same machinery as the PCA PSF).

| Returns | Type | Description |

| `psf` | `lsst.meas.algorithms.KernelPsf` | The spatially varying PSF. |

### pipeline.fitBrightnessTerm

`fitBrightnessTerm(exposure, psf, res, badBitmask, P, fitkw, verbose=True)`

Measure or update the brightness-dependent PSF term (brighter-fatter).

From isolated, unsaturated stars with peak S/N >= ``bfMinSnr``: per 1-px ring, a weighted fit ``residual/flux = A(r) + B(r) * (log10 flux - L0)`` gives the slope B(r), smoothed, tapered and made flux-neutral.  Built from half of the stars and judged on the other half; kept only if the held-out chi2 improves.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The fitted exposure. |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | Current PSF. |
| `res` | `dict` | Result of `runInnerAdaptive`. |
| `badBitmask` | `int` | Mask bits of pixels to ignore. |

### pipeline.refitBackgroundLowfit

`refitBackgroundLowfit(exposure, mode='plane', statsMask=('BAD', 'SAT', 'EDGE', 'NO_DATA', 'DETECTED', 'CR', 'INTRP'), clip=3.0, nIter=5, verbose=True)`

Fit a constant or tilted-plane background to the unmasked pixels and subtract it in place.

The robust alternative to `fitLib.refitBackground` for small cutouts of an image that is already background-subtracted: a spline / Chebyshev surface on 32 px bins is barely constrained where most pixels are masked and can swing by hundreds of counts in a corner.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Exposure to background-subtract in place (sources flagged DETECTED). |
| `mode` | `str`, optional | 'plane' (a + b x + c y), 'constant' or 'none'. |
| `statsMask` | `tuple` [`str`], optional | Mask planes whose pixels are ignored. |
| `clip` | `float`, optional | Sigma clipping threshold. |

| Returns | Type | Description |

| `background` | `lsst.afw.image.ImageF` | The subtracted background image. |

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timer` | `lsst.meas.crowd.fitLib.StepTimer`, optional | Timer (default: fitLib's ``TIMER``). |

### pipeline.runAdaptivePipeline

| --- | --- | --- |
| `outerHistory` | `list` [`dict`] | One dict per outer pass (as `fitLib.runCutoutPipeline`'s, plus ``psfChange``, ``modelErr``, ``bf`` and ``result['adaptive']``). |

### pipeline.dropOffDetectorGaia

`dropOffDetectorGaia(exposure, xy, rows)`

Drop Gaia starting positions that lie beyond the detector edge.

A star outside the cutout whose nearest cutout pixel is flagged EDGE or NO_DATA lies off the detector: no pixel constrains its flux, so the joint fit can give it an absurd value whose wings then spoil the edge of the image.  Stars outside a cutout edge that is not a detector edge are kept (their wings fall on real pixels and their neighbours need them).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The cutout. |
| `xy` | `numpy.ndarray` | Gaia positions (detector px), shape (N, 2). |

`checkBrightNeighbours(run, brightSnr=300.0, withinFwhm=4.0, fluxRatio=5.0, nControls=7, plot=True, maxShow=16, verbose=True, similarMin=3)`

Test whether sources on the edges of bright stars are real.

For every source within ``withinFwhm`` FWHM of a star at least ``fluxRatio`` times brighter (with peak S/N >= ``brightSnr``), its PSF-weighted flux is compared with the residual's flux at control positions at the same distance from the bright star, rotated in 45-degree steps. A mismatch pattern of the bright star (rings, spikes, lobes) puts similar flux at several angles; a real star is significantly brighter than its controls.  Verdicts: 'Gaia' (real by construction), 'real' (significance >= 5 and at most one similar angle), 'probable' (significance >= 3, or two similar angles), 'doubtful' (significance < 3, or similar flux at >= ``similarMin`` angles).

| Parameter | Type | Description |

### pipeline.diagnoseResidual

`diagnoseResidual(run, brightSnr=300.0, diskFwhm=3.0, plot=True)`

Decide whether what is left around bright stars is noise or model error.

For empty sky, bright-star disks (within ``diskFwhm`` FWHM of stars with peak S/N >= ``brightSnr``) and other source pixels: ``sigmaZ`` (robust std of residual/sigma; 1 = matches the variance plane) and ``coherence`` (robust std of the 3x3-averaged residual/sigma, x3, over sigmaZ, squared; white noise gives 1).  Also the pixel-to-pixel scatter against model flux, which measures missing photon noise.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |
| `brightSnr` | `float`, optional | Minimum peak S/N of a bright star. |

Find the pixels whose residual cannot be judged because a source there is partly masked.

Everything within ``padFwhm`` FWHM of a bad pixel, plus any positive residual blob (matched-filter S/N > ``growSnr``) touching that pad, out to ``reachFwhm`` FWHM from the mask.  Masked cores whose star is in the model (``modeled``, near-saturated cores fitted from their wings) get no pad: the residual next to them is real information.

Stack the bright stars' residuals to show the pattern they all share.

The median of the bright, clean, unsaturated stars' residuals, each divided by the star's flux and centred on its sub-pixel position, once with the PSF-only joint model and once with the final model (including the per-star corrections).  A pattern that survives the median is common to all bright stars, i.e. a feature missing from the PSF model; noise and star-specific errors average out.  Also prints the core error of the brighter and fainter half of the stars (a brighter-fatter test) and shows the PSF kernel.

| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |

Print side-by-side numbers for several runs of the same cutouts.

For each cutout and variant: robust residual/sigma, number of sources and the stacked PSF-only residual of the bright stars (median residual / flux x 1e5) in radial bins -- a ring shows as a large value in one bin; values closer to 0 mean a better PSF.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `minSnr` | `float`, optional | Minimum peak S/N of the stacked stars. |

### plotting.coreExcessDiagnostic

`coreExcessDiagnostic(run, minSnr=100.0, plot=True)`

Find out why bright stars' cores are sharper than the model.

For each unsaturated, fairly isolated star with peak S/N >= ``minSnr``, the central excess (data - model summed over the central 3x3 px, divided by the model there) is correlated with flux (sensor effects or a flux-dependent PSF), peak / saturation level (non-linearity) and sub-pixel phase (stamps blurred by sub-pixel shifting).  No trend but a significant excess means the PSF core itself is too broad.  A trend only counts if it is large compared with the excess itself.

| `minSnr` | `float`, optional | Minimum peak S/N of the stars used. |

### plotting.plotResidualGray

Plot the two residual panels of `plotFinalComparison`, larger and in greyscale.

Black = negative, white = positive; areas that cannot be modelled are drawn in blue.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |
| `**kw` | – | Keyword arguments of `plotFinalComparison`. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `stats` | `dict` | See `plotFinalComparison`. |

### plotting.starResidualTable

`starResidualTable(run, minSnr=30.0, rFwhm=2.5, plot=True, nWorst=10)`

Find which stars carry the leftover residual, and what they have in common.

For every unsaturated point source with peak S/N >= ``minSnr``: chi2 per pixel within ``rFwhm`` FWHM for the final and the PSF-only model, the PSF-only core residual (flux within 1 FWHM / star flux; < 0 = star broader than the PSF) and the mismatch (residual flux beyond the noise / star flux, independent of brightness).  The mismatch is rank-correlated with flux, position and crowding, and outlier stars are counted.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |
| `minSnr` | `float`, optional | Minimum peak S/N. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### plotting.plotFinalComparison

`plotFinalComparison(run, view='interior', badColor='#ff00ff', circles='images', showZones=True, excludeNearMask=True, excludedColor='#8c8c8c', maskPadFwhm=1.5, zClip=5.0, residClipPct=99.0, figsize=(26, 7), sigma='model', nearsatColor='#ff9900', grayscale=False, panels='all', verbose=True)`

Plot original | final model | residual | residual/sigma of a run.

Bad pixels are drawn opaque in one colour (default magenta) in all four panels and excluded from the statistics.  Saturated-star zones have a dashed outline, extended sources dashed circles.  Pixels whose flux belongs to sources under the mask (which the model cannot fit) are greyed out and excluded too.

| `grayscale` | `bool`, optional | Residual panels in greyscale (excluded areas then in blue). |
| `panels` | `str`, optional | 'all' (four panels) or 'residuals' (the two residual panels, larger). |

Plot how the fitted photometry and positions compare with Gaia.

Four panels for the Gaia-matched point sources with PSF S/N >= ``minSnr``: magnitude difference (offset removed) against Gaia G and against Gaia BP - RP (the colour term between G and the LSST band), the position offsets, and the offsets as arrows across the image (a pattern there is a WCS distortion; scatter is centroid noise).

| Parameter | Type | Description |

Return the candidate and used PSF stars of one of the pipeline's PSF determinations.

Exactly one source is used, in this order: a catalogue with ``calib_psf_candidate`` / ``calib_psf_used`` flags (the visit PSF's own stars), a session (the detector-level ``psfSource='refit'`` PSF), or a run (the clean stars the residual-stack PSF update after pass ``outer`` used).

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.Session`, optional | A session prepared with ``psfSource='refit'``. |
| `catalog` | `lsst.afw.table.SourceCatalog` or `astropy.table.Table`, optional | A source catalogue with PSF flags, e.g. the visit's ``single_visit_star_unstandardized``. |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun`, optional | A finished run. |

### stagePlots.showBackgrounds

`showBackgrounds(run, initial=None, figsizePerPanel=4.2, out=None)`

Plot the background entering every outer pass, and the change from pass to pass.

Pass 1 uses ``initial`` (the detector-level background of ``psfSource='refit'``; a visit image is already background-subtracted, so there is none).  Before each later pass the background is refitted on the raw cutout with the previous pass's sources masked.

``level='outer'``: one row per outer pass (each with its own background and PSF). ``level='inner'``: one row per inner iteration of outer pass ``outer`` (the source list growing as the detection threshold steps down).  Data and model share one colour scale, and the residual one scale for all rows, so the rows can be compared.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

### stagePlots.comparePasses

`comparePasses(run, a=-2, b=-1, matchPx=1.0, nShow=8, half=12, plot=True, out=None)`

Find the sources that one outer pass lost or gained relative to another, and why.

Sources are matched by position (within ``matchPx``).  For every source of pass ``a`` without a match in pass ``b`` the residual of pass ``b`` is measured at its position with a PSF-weighted (matched-filter) flux: if most of its flux is still there, a real source was lost; if a neighbour within 1.5 FWHM gained that flux, it was merged; if a halo or ring check removed it, it is also blocked from re-detection in later passes.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run with at least two outer passes. |
| `a, b` | `int`, optional | The two outer passes to compare (default: the last two). |

| `table` | `astropy.table.Table` | One row per lost or gained source: ``kind`` ('lost' / 'gained'), ``x``, ``y``, ``flux``, ``snr`` (peak S/N in the pass it exists in), ``gaia``, ``fluxLeft`` and ``leftSnr`` (matched-filter flux and S/N in the residual of the pass without it), ``leftFrac``, ``nearestPx`` (distance to the nearest source of the other pass), ``nearestDflux`` (that source's flux change) and ``verdict``. |

Raises: `ValueError` (Raised if the run has fewer than two outer passes.)

### stagePlots.showLinkedSourcePages

`showLinkedSourcePages(run, outer=-1, snap=-1, sources=None, sourceView='all', sourcesPerPage=6, maxPages=1, viewHalf=20, showPages=True, outDir=None, pdf=None, dpi=80, figsize=(21, 7.5), out=None)`

Plot per-source pages whose coloured frames match boxes on the data, model and residual.

For each page: an overview (data | model | residual of the whole cutout) with one coloured box per source on that page -- the window its row shows -- then the page itself: one row per source with data | model | residual | x cross-section | y cross-section, framed in the same colour.

For many pages use ``outDir``: every figure is written to its own PNG file and closed at once, so memory stays flat.  A `PdfPages` (``pdf``) keeps every image in memory until it is closed (matplotlib), which can exhaust a notebook's memory for hundreds of sources.

| `run` | `lsst.meas.crowd.session.CutoutRun` | A finished run. |
| `outer` | `int`, optional | Outer pass. |

| `sources` | `list`, optional | Source indices, or (x, y) detector positions (the nearest source is used); None = choose with ``sourceView``. |
| `sourceView` | `str`, optional | 'all' (brightest first), 'new' or 'changed' (see `fitLib.selectSourcePages`). |
| `sourcesPerPage` | `int`, optional | Rows per page. |
| `maxPages` | `int`, optional | Maximum number of pages (None = all). |
| `viewHalf` | `int`, optional | Half-size of each source window [px] (the size of the boxes). |
| `showPages` | `bool`, optional | Draw the pages (False = only the overviews). |
| `outDir` | `str`, optional | Write ``overview_NNN.png`` and ``page_NNN.png`` here instead of showing them. |
| `pdf` | `matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf.PdfPages`, optional | Open PDF; the overviews and pages are saved into it instead of being shown. |
| `dpi` | `int`, optional | Resolution of the saved pages. |
| `figsize` | `tuple` [`float`, `float`], optional | Size of the overview [inches]. |
| `out` | `str`, optional | Also save the first overview to this file. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `linked` | `dict` | ``pages`` (source indices per page), ``colors`` (colour per source index) and ``files`` (the PNG files written with ``outDir``). |

Raises: `ValueError` (Raised if the snapshot no longer has the per-source stamps.)

Fit this task's share of a detector's tiles and write one file per tile.

Tiles already on disk are skipped, so the job can be restarted; a failing tile is reported and the task moves on.  With ``plots``, every diagnostic plot of the chosen tiles (`lsst.meas.crowd.runPlots.saveRunPlots`) goes to ``<plotDir>/<tile name>/``, and task 0 also writes the detector-level PSF plots to ``<plotDir>/detector/``; a chosen tile whose plots are missing is refitted even if its tile file exists.

Return the number of CPUs this process may actually use.

Container CPU limits (the RSP's notebook servers, Kubernetes) are set as a cgroup quota, not by hiding cores: ``os.cpu_count()`` and even ``os.sched_getaffinity`` can show every core of the node (e.g. 128) while the quota allows 4.  The quota is read from cgroup v2 (``cpu.max``) or v1 (``cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us`` / ``cpu.cfs_period_us``); the smaller of it and the visible CPUs is returned, at least 1.

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `verbose` | `bool`, optional | Print what was done. |

Assemble the tile files into full-detector images and one catalogue.

Writes the mosaic (DATA, MODEL, RESIDUAL, RESIDUAL_SIGMA, VARIANCE, BAD and TILE extensions) and the catalogue (every source once, from the tile whose interior contains it) into ``outDir``.  Tile files from older versions without the residual images get them added (`addTileResiduals`).

### fitLib.collapseSaturatedPeaks

`collapseSaturatedPeaks(peakPositions, exposure, satBitmask=None, dilateIters=2)`

Collapse every peak on or near a saturated blob into one peak per blob.

The representative position is a flux-weighted centroid from the unsaturated ring just outside the saturated core (the flat top carries no usable position or flux information). Without this, noise on the saturated flat top produces many near-duplicate peaks whose PSF stamps are almost identical; the joint fit then splits the true amplitude between them arbitrarily, which shows up as a blocky, high-frequency patch in the model image.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peakPositions` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Peak (x, y) positions in parent pixel coordinates. |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Exposure the peaks were detected on. |
| `satBitmask` | `int`, optional | Mask bits of saturated pixels (default: the SAT plane). |
| `dilateIters` | `int`, optional | Number of dilations of the saturated region when assigning peaks to a blob. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peaks` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Peaks with every saturated blob reduced to one representative peak. |
| `nRemoved` | `int` | Number of peaks removed. |

### fitLib.mergeClosePeaks

`mergeClosePeaks(peakPositions, exposure, minSeparation=None)`

Merge peaks closer than ``minSeparation``, keeping the brightest pixel's peak.

Prevents near-duplicate columns in the design matrix (mostly from re-detecting the same wings) from destabilising the joint solve.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peakPositions` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Peak (x, y) positions in parent pixel coordinates. |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Exposure whose pixel values rank the peaks. |
| `minSeparation` | `float`, optional | Merge radius [px] (default: twice the PSF sigma). |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mergedPositions` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Surviving peak positions. |

### fitLib.jointPsfFit

`jointPsfFit(exposure, psf, peakPositions, badBitmask, ampZeroTol=1e-06)`

Fit all PSF amplitudes simultaneously with a non-negative least-squares solve.

One sparse, weighted, bound-constrained solve against the original exposure.  Unlike an unconstrained solve followed by clipping, ``lsq_linear`` with bounds (0, inf) lets the other amplitudes re-adjust when one source is pushed to zero, so overlapping sources get a real non-negative amplitude instead of one of them being dropped from the model.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Image to fit (image, variance and mask planes are used). |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | PSF model. |
| `peakPositions` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Source (x, y) positions in parent pixel coordinates. |
| `badBitmask` | `int` | Mask bits of pixels to ignore. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| `amps` | `numpy.ndarray` | Fitted amplitudes (fluxes), one per position. |
| `modelFull` | `numpy.ndarray` | Model image over the exposure's box. |
| `nAtZeroBound` | `int` | Number of sources that converged to (numerically) zero amplitude -- sources that still fail to fit rather than being absent. |

### fitLib.iterativeJointDetection

`iterativeJointDetection(exposure, psf, badBitmask, nIterations=10, thresholdStart=8.0, thresholdStep=-1.5, thresholdMin=1.5, minPixels=1, minNewPeaks=2, convergenceFrac=0.02, verbose=True)`

Detect, fit and subtract iteratively until the residual stops yielding new sources.

Each pass: (1) detect on the current residual with a decreasing threshold, so fainter sources are searched for once brighter ones are gone; (2) collapse multiple peaks on saturated cores; (3) merge the new peaks with all peaks found so far; (4) refit all of them jointly against the original exposure with a non-negative solve; (5) rebuild the residual. Every pass is a full re-solve, so errors from an early pass are not compounded.  The number of zero-amplitude sources is printed each pass: if it is large or not shrinking, real sources are being fitted down to nothing.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Image to fit. |
| `psf` | `lsst.afw.detection.Psf` | PSF model. |

| `minNewPeaks` | `int`, optional | Stop when a pass finds fewer new peaks than this. |
| `convergenceFrac` | `float`, optional | Stop when the residual standard deviation improves by less than this fraction. |
| `verbose` | `bool`, optional | Print progress. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `result` | `dict` | ``modelFull``, ``residualFull``, ``peaks``, ``amps``, the per-pass histories (``residStdHistory``, ``nPeaksHistory``, ``nZeroAmpHistory``) and ``firstSeen`` (pass index at which each peak, keyed by its position rounded to 0.1 px, was found). |

### fitLib.plotTiledComparison

`plotTiledComparison(dataFull, modelFull, residualFull, nSources=None, nPasses=None, tileSize=100, cmapImg=None, globalScale=True, skipEmpty=True, emptyStdThresh=1e-06, figsizePerPanel=5, showRowProfile=True, rowSelect='maxFlux', stretch='log')`

Plot data, model and residual (and a row profile) for every tile of an image.

The data and model panels share one colour scale when ``globalScale`` is True; the residual panel always scales to its own tile.  With ``showRowProfile`` a fourth panel shows data and model along one row of the tile (marked with a dashed cyan line), so the model can be compared with the data through a crowded section.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dataFull, modelFull, residualFull` | `numpy.ndarray` | Data, model and residual images (same shape). |
| `nSources` | `int`, optional | Number of sources, for the title. |

| `rowSelect` | `str`, `int` or callable, optional | Row of each tile to profile: 'maxFlux' (the row with the most flux), a row index local to the tile, or a function ``rowSelect(tileData) -> row index``. |
| `stretch` | `str`, optional | Stretch of the data / model colour scale. |

### fitLib.plotDetectionsByIteration

`plotDetectionsByIteration(exposureCrop, resultIter)`

Plot every fitted peak over the image, coded by the pass that first found it.

Peaks whose final amplitude is (numerically) zero -- they hit the non-negativity bound -- are marked as failed fits with a red 'x'; they are the ones to inspect if sources seem to be missing from the model.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposureCrop` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Image the pipeline ran on. |
| `resultIter` | `dict` | Output of `iterativeJointDetection`. |

### fitLib.maskSourcesFromModel

`maskSourcesFromModel(exposure, modelFull, noiseSigma=None, nSigma=4.0, dilateIters=1, verbose=True)`

Flag pixels where the joint-fit model has significant flux as DETECTED.

The next background fit then treats them as source, not sky.  The joint model contains all sources found so far, including ones too faint for the first background pass.  A loose threshold flags most of the image and starves the background fit; if the printed masked fraction climbs much above ~50 %, tighten ``nSigma`` or ``dilateIters``.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Exposure whose mask is modified in place. |
| `modelFull` | `numpy.ndarray` | Model image over the exposure's box. |

| `dilateIters` | `int`, optional | Number of dilations of the flagged region. |
| `verbose` | `bool`, optional | Print the masked fraction. |

| Returns | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `srcMask` | `numpy.ndarray` [`bool`] | The flagged pixels. |

Re-derive the background ignoring masked pixels and subtract it in place.

Pass a fresh clone of the raw (never background-subtracted) exposure, already flagged by `maskSourcesFromModel`, or the background is subtracted twice.

| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | The background-subtracted exposure (same object). |

`catalogFromPeaks(exposure, peakPositions, schema, measureTask, stampRadius=15, excludePositions=None, excludeRadius=5.0, verbose=True)`

Build a measured SourceCatalog from raw (x, y) peak positions.

Each peak gets a circular footprint and one Peak record, and the catalogue is measured with the same ``measureTask`` as fresh detections, so the fields are comparable and usable by the star selector.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exposure` | `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` | Exposure to measure on. |
| `peakPositions` | `list` [`tuple` [`float`, `float`]] | Peak positions in parent pixel coordinates. |

| `measureTask` | `lsst.meas.base.SingleFrameMeasurementTask` | Measurement task. |

Detect, deblend, measure, select stars and determine a new PSF.

Run in each outer pass, so it works on the newly cleaned background.  Extra peak positions (e.g. the previous pass's converged catalogue) are added before star selection; forced star positions are appended after selection, bypassing its cuts.  Candidates with failed stamps are filtered out before the PSF determiner runs (even one can make it reject the whole set).  If too few candidates survive, the exposure's current PSF is kept and a "NOT updated" note is printed.

`computePsfDerivatives(psf, x, y, bboxClip, eps=0.25)`

Compute central-difference derivative stamps dP/dx and dP/dy.

``computeImage`` centres its box on the pixel nearest the requested point, so the stamps at (x +- eps, y) and (x, y +- eps) need not share a box; all five boxes (and the clip box) are intersected first.

Move each well-detected source towards the position that minimises its residual.

Linearised Gauss-Newton with all other sources held fixed: over the source's core pixels, weighted by 1/sigma, ``(data - model) ~ dA * P + a * dx * dP/dx + a * dy * dP/dy``.

`extendKernelWithMoffat(kernel, newSize=81, fitR=(6.0, 14.0), blend=(12.0, 16.0))`

Replace the noisy outer part of a PSF kernel by an analytic Moffat tail.

The azimuthal-mean profile between ``fitR[0]`` and ``fitR[1]`` px is fitted with ``A * (1 + (r/a)^2)^-b`` (relative weighting, so faint outer bins count).  The new kernel equals the original inside ``blend[0]``, the Moffat beyond ``blend[1]``, with a linear cross-fade between, and is renormalised -- fitted amplitudes then become total fluxes including the tail.  Works on an already-extended kernel too.

Estimate the number of false detections from the residual itself.

Counts pixels of the matched-filter S/N map of the final residual at >= +N sigma and at <= -N sigma.  Real sources are positive only, so the negative excursions approximate the positive noise excursions (false positives); PSF-mismatch dipoles inflate both.

Count positive and negative peaks of the residual's matched-filter S/N.
