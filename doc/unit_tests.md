# meas_crowd: unit tests

Every unit test in `tests/`: what it checks, what it feeds in, and what it must get back to
pass.  How to run them and read the results is in the
[pipeline guide](pipeline_guide.md#unit-tests-running-them-and-checking-the-results).

The suite has **158 tests in 15 files**.  Without the Rubin stack 156 run and the 2 in
`test_fastStampsStack.py` are skipped; `testCxxEqualsNumpy` is also skipped if the C++ extension
was not built, and the `test_sparseSolver.py` solver tests if it was built without the
sparse solver.  `test_docstrings.py` checks that this page lists every test and that the
[function reference](function_reference.md) is up to date.

## How the tests work

Each test builds a small **synthetic** image or table whose correct answer is known (stars of
known flux and position, a known PSF, known noise), runs one function on it and compares the
result with that answer.  No test needs data access.

Shared helpers:

| Helper | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/lsstStubs.py` | Stand-ins for the Rubin stack so the tests run without it: working `lsst.geom` boxes and points, `FakeExposure` (image, variance, mask, PSF, optional PhotoCalib), `FakePsf` (a fixed kernel image), `gaussianKernel`, `gaussianComp` (a unit Gaussian stamp at a sub-pixel position, in the joint fit's component format) and `place` (add a stamp into an image).  `install()` does nothing when the real stack is set up |
| `tests/fakeRun.py` | `makeRun(...)`: a finished run with the same structure as `runSessionGaia`'s result: a grid of Gaussian stars (default 4 × 4 in a 120 × 130 px image at detector position (1000, 2000), fluxes 3×10³–3×10⁵, sky 100) with Poisson noise, fitted by least squares with the true PSF (a perfect model) unless `modelSigma` or `sigmaFn` make the model wrong on purpose.  `run.truthFlux` holds the true fluxes |

Plotting tests use the non-interactive `Agg` backend; they check that the figure or file is made
and that returned numbers are right, not how the picture looks.

## test_fastKernels.py

The fast PSF-stamp kernels in `fastKernels.py` (Lanczos-5 sub-pixel shifts, stamps, derivatives,
taper), in both the C++ and the NumPy implementation.

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LanczosWeightsTestCase.testNormalised` | Lanczos-5 interpolation weights conserve flux | sub-pixel shifts −0.5, −0.31, 0, 0.2, 0.49 | 10 weights each, summing to 1 (to 10⁻¹²) |
| `LanczosWeightsTestCase.testZeroShiftIsIdentity` | A zero shift leaves the image unchanged | shift 0 | the weight on the centre pixel is 1, all others 0 |
| `ShiftTestCase.testShiftMatchesAnalyticGaussian` | `shiftImage` moves an image by a fraction of a pixel correctly | a Gaussian (σ = 2.6 px), shifts (0.3, −0.2), (−0.45, 0.1), (0, 0.5); NumPy and C++ | result matches the exactly shifted Gaussian to 0.3 % of the peak |
| `ShiftTestCase.testIntegerShift` | A whole-pixel shift is an exact copy | Gaussian, shift (1, 0) | columns shifted by one, to 10⁻¹² |
| `ShiftTestCase.testCxxEqualsNumpy` | The C++ and NumPy versions give the same numbers | an elliptical kernel, 50 random positions, with and without taper; stamps and derivatives | identical to 10⁻¹² of the peak (skipped if C++ is not built) |
| `RenderTestCase.testOriginConvention` | Stamps sit where `lsst.afw` puts them | positions x = 50.4, 50.6, 50.5 | stamp origin = floor(x + 0.5) − half, as afw's `computeImage` |

| `RenderTestCase.testTaperMatchesReference` | The wing taper equals `fitLib.psfStamp`'s (pedestal removed, raised-cosine edge) | elliptical kernel + pedestal, taper (0.75, 1.0) | equal to the formula to 10⁻¹⁵ (NumPy and C++) |
| `FastPsfTestCase.testStampClip` | Stamps are clipped to the image box | `FastPsf` stamp near the corner, and one far outside | box (0, 0, 15, 15), shape 16 × 16; outside → None |
| `FastPsfTestCase.testDerivativesClip` | Derivative stamps are clipped too | derivatives at (50.1, 50.2) with box starting at (45, 45) | box (45, 45, 60, 60), both derivative arrays the same shape |
| `FastPsfTestCase.testValidate` | The check against the reference PSF accepts a match and rejects a mismatch | a reference renderer with the same kernel, and one 10 % too bright | first validates True, second False |

## test_fastStampsStack.py

Runs only with the Rubin stack (skipped otherwise).

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `StackComparisonTestCase.testStampsMatchComputeImage` | Fast stamps reproduce afw's `psf.computeImage` | a `KernelPsf` (elliptical core + faint exponential wing), 20 random positions | same origin; pixels agree to 0.2 % of the peak |

## test_sparseSolver.py

`LeastSquaresConjugateGradient` inside an active-set loop for x >= 0) and its use by the pipeline
(`jointSolver` option).

## test_psfRefit.py

| `UnmodeledMaskTestCase.testNoPadAroundModeledCores` | The "cannot be modelled" mask | a near-saturated core (modelled from its wings), a missing neighbour, a bad column | > 100 px greyed at the core without the `modeled` hint, 0 with it; the bad column keeps its margin; nothing greyed with no bad pixels |
| `PlotSmokeTestCase.testFinalComparison` | `plotFinalComparison` options | default `fakeRun`; 4 option sets | runs; residual/σ spread = 1 ± 0.1 |
| `PlotSmokeTestCase.testCrossSectionsAndZooms` | `showCrossSections`, `showStarZooms` | one star; the 2 worst stars | one set of cuts returned; zooms run |
| `PlotSmokeTestCase.testBrightStarStack` | `showBrightStarStack` | bright stars (S/N ≥ 100), perfect model | > 5 stars stacked; stacked residual < 10⁻³ of the flux |

## test_sourcePlots.py

Per-source cutouts, cross-sections and their selection (`sourcePlots.py`).

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CutoutDataTestCase.testPerfectModel` | `sourceCutoutData` windows and cuts | a Gaussian star (flux 5000) at (140.3, 235.7), data = model | window (130, 150, 226, 246), 21 × 21; all residuals and χ² 0; x-cut peaks within 0.5 px of the star |
| `CutoutDataTestCase.testNoiseOnlyChi2` | χ² of the cuts with noise only | the same star + Poisson noise | χ² per cut ≈ 1 (within 0.8) |
| `CutoutDataTestCase.testBadPixelsIgnored` | Bad pixels are left out of the cuts | the star's row masked and set to 10⁹ | x-cut residual stays 0 |
| `CutoutDataTestCase.testEdge` | A source at the image corner | star at (101, 201) | window clipped at the image edge (100, 200) |
| `SelectTestCase.testSelections` | `selectSources` | 5 sources with S/N and χ² | worst = [2, 3] (S/N 5 excluded), brightest = [4, 2], faintest = [3], random 3, by position = [2, 0]; unknown mode raises ValueError |
| `PlotSmokeTestCase.testPlotAndPdf` | `plotSourceCutouts` with a PDF | default `fakeRun`, 3 brightest, 2 per page | PDF written; 3 rows with finite magnitudes |

## test_stagePlots.py

The stage plots and the pass-to-pass comparison (`stagePlots.py`).  Most use a `fakeRun` turned
into two outer passes with three inner snapshots (the first missing half the stars) and a tilted
background in pass 2.

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PsfStarsTestCase.testCatalogFlags` | PSF stars from a catalogue's flags | table with `slot_Centroid_x/y`, `calib_psf_candidate`, `calib_psf_used` | 3 candidates; the 2 used stars at the right positions |
| `PsfStarsTestCase.testSession` | PSF stars of a refit session | session with `starCat` and `psfUsedXy` | 2 candidates, 1 used; ValueError for a visit-PSF session or no input |
| `PsfStarsTestCase.testRunStarsAreBrightSources` | PSF stars of the in-cutout stack | two-pass run | some stars used, no more than the candidates, each one of the run's sources |
| `PsfStarsTestCase.testPlotKernel` | `showPsfStars` | two-pass run | PNG written; FWHM = 2.355 × 2 ± 0.15 px; kernel sums to 1 |
| `BackgroundAndRoundsTestCase.testBackgrounds` | `showBackgrounds` | initial background 2.0; pass-2 tilted plane; then no initial | 2 backgrounds, pass 2 equal to the input; None for pass 1 without an initial one |
| `BackgroundAndRoundsTestCase.testOuterRounds` | `showRounds(level="outer")` | two-pass run, perfect final model | 2 rows; last residual/σ spread 1 ± 0.1 |
| `BackgroundAndRoundsTestCase.testInnerRounds` | `showRounds(level="inner")` | 3 snapshots, zoomed view | source counts 8, 16, 16; residual/σ larger while stars are missing; `maxRows=2` gives 2 rows; bad `level` raises ValueError |
| `LinkedPagesTestCase.testColoursMatch` | Overview boxes match the page colours | sources by index and by position | pages [[0, 5]]; box colours = page colours |
| `LinkedPagesTestCase.testDefaultSelectionAndSlimSnapshot` | Default selection; old snapshots | 4 per page | the 4 brightest; ValueError for a snapshot without stamps |
| `LinkedPagesTestCase.testOutDirWritesEveryPageAndClosesFigures` | `outDir` writes one PNG per page and frees memory | all 16 sources, 4 per page | 4 pages, 8 files (overview + page each), no figures left open |
| `ComparePassesTestCase.testVerdicts` | `comparePasses` finds and explains changes | pass a: 15 stars + 1 fake source; pass b: drops 2 real stars (one marked as removed by the halo check), gains 1 | 3 lost, 1 gained; real star "LOST" with ~100 % of its flux left; halo-check star "blocked"; fake "spurious" with < 20 % left; gained star "missing from the residual" |
| `ComparePassesTestCase.testPlotAndErrors` | Its plot; a one-pass run | the same | PNG written; ValueError with one pass |

## test_detector.py

Whole-detector tiling, per-tile files, stitching, plots and the command line (`detector.py`,
`bin.src/crowdDetector.py`).  The per-tile fit (which needs the stack) is replaced by a perfect
synthetic one: a 600 × 500 px "detector" with 60 Gaussian stars; everything around it is the
real code.

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TileSpecTestCase.testPartition` | Tile interiors cover the detector exactly once | 4 detector / tile sizes incl. LSSTCam 4072 × 4000 with 400 px tiles | every pixel in exactly one tile; 110 tiles for LSSTCam |
| `TileSpecTestCase.testRegion` | Only tiles overlapping a region; tile names | region in a 600 × 500 detector | one tile at (200, 0); name "x0200_y0000_200x167" |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testTasksResumeAndStitch` | Slurm-style task split, restart, stitch | 2 tasks of 9 tiles, then a rerun | tasks share the 9 tiles without overlap; rerun refits nothing; mosaic data and model equal the inputs; residual/σ spread ≈ 1; every star once with the right flux; files reload |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testRegionAndGaps` | A partial run | only the corner tile | 1 file; mosaic 200 × 167 px |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testFailingTileDoesNotStopTask` | One failing tile | one tile raises an error | the other 8 written; the gap marked in the TILE map |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testParallelWorkersSameAsSerial` | `fitTiles(nJobs=3)`: tiles fitted in forked worker processes | the synthetic 3 x 3-tile detector, one tile raising an error | 8 tile files and 9 logs; a rerun fits only the failed tile; the stitched model, tile map and catalogue equal a serial run's |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testConfigSettingsNotOverridden` | `fitTiles` leaves the configuration's own `maxOuter` alone (e.g. a single-pass configuration) | a configuration with `maxOuter=1`, then an explicit `maxOuter=2` | no `maxOuter` override in the first call (`maxInner` gets its default 15); the explicit 2 in the second |
| `CpuLimitTestCase.testQuota` | `availableCpus` reads container CPU quotas, which do not hide the node's cores | fake cgroup v2 / v1 files (4-CPU quota on 128 visible cores, no quota, fractional quota, no files) | 4, 128, 2, 128, 128, 1; and never more than the visible CPUs |
| `CpuLimitTestCase.testLimitBlasThreads` | `limitBlasThreads` caps NumPy's BLAS / OpenMP threads | a cap of 2 | every thread pool has <= 2 threads and the environment variables say 2 (skipped without threadpoolctl) |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testPlot` | `plotDetector` | stitched mosaic; a zoom, greyscale, sources circled | PNG written; residual/σ spread ≈ 1; binning 1 for the zoom |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testTile` | `loadTile`, `plotTile` | the corner tile | interior at (0, 0), width = interior + 20 px pad; `owned` count right; PNG written; residual/σ ≈ 1 |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testResidualImages` | Tile files and the mosaic carry the residual images | the corner tile; its stitched mosaic | tiles have DATA, MODEL, RESIDUAL, RESIDUAL_SIGMA, VARIANCE, BAD; RESIDUAL = DATA − MODEL and RESIDUAL_SIGMA = RESIDUAL / √VARIANCE; the mosaic has RESIDUAL_SIGMA with scatter ≈ 1; `loadMosaic` / `loadTile` return `residSigma` |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testOldTilesGetResiduals` | Tiles written by older versions (no residual images) are upgraded without refitting | the corner tile with RESIDUAL / RESIDUAL_SIGMA removed | `addTileResiduals` rewrites it once (a second call changes nothing), the extensions are in order, and stitching still works |
| `FitStitchTestCase.testCli` | `crowdDetector.py stitch` and `plot` | fitted tiles | both return 0; `detector_view.png` written |

## test_compat.py

The package switched from snake_case to Rubin's camelCase names; the old names still work.

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SnakeCaseCompatTestCase.testToCamel` | snake_case is turned into camelCase correctly | `runSessionGaia`, `_fitOne`, `PIPELINE_DEFAULTS`, `report` | leading underscores and UPPER_CASE constants are kept |
| `SnakeCaseCompatTestCase.testOldFunctionNames` | Old function names still find the renamed function | `crowd.runSessionGaia`, `pipeline.runCutoutGaia` | each is the camelCase function and a `FutureWarning` is raised; unknown names still raise `AttributeError` |
| `SnakeCaseCompatTestCase.testOldConfigKeys` | Old option names in configurations still work | `stackKwargs=dict(nUse=5)`, `seedThresholdStart`, `nCentroidRounds` | the values land in `stackKwargs["nUse"]`, `gaiaThresholdStart` and `nCentroidRounds` |

## test_runPlots.py

Writing every plot of a run, of the detector-level PSF, and of chosen tiles of a detector run.

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SampleTilesTestCase.testCornersCentreAndEdges` | The sample tiles of a detector | the 110 tiles of a 4072 × 4000 px detector | 7 different tiles, the bottom-left and top-right corner tiles among them |
| `SampleTilesTestCase.testOneTileDetector` | A detector smaller than one tile | a 300 × 300 px detector | its single tile, once |
| `SaveRunPlotsTestCase.testWritesEveryStage` | `saveRunPlots` writes every stage and describes it | a synthetic run with two outer passes and three inner iterations | PSF models, backgrounds, outer and inner rounds and the final comparison exist; every PNG is in `index.txt`; files are numbered in order; `report.txt` exists; no figure left open |
| `SaveRunPlotsTestCase.testFailingPlotIsSkipped` | A failing plot does not stop the others | one plot function that raises, one that works | the working one is saved; the failure is listed in `index.txt` |
| `DetectorPlotsTestCase.testStampsAndDetectorPlots` | PSF-star stamps and the detector-level PSF plots | 16 synthetic stars; a catalogue with `calib_psf_*` flags; no catalogue | 5 stamps for `maxStamps=5`, none off the image; stars and stamps written with a catalogue, kernels only without |
| `FitTilesPlotsTestCase.testSampleTilesAndDetectorPlots` | `fitTiles(plots="sample")` | a synthetic 600 × 500 px detector, plot functions recorded | plots for exactly the sample tiles and one detector-level set; a second call redoes nothing |
| `FitTilesPlotsTestCase.testPlotsForAnAlreadyFittedTile` | Plots for a tile fitted without them | a finished run, then `plots=[one tile]` | only that tile is refitted and plotted |

## test_docstrings.py

| Test | What it checks | Input | Passes when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DocstringTestCase.testNumpydoc` | Every public function, class and method has an LSST (numpydoc) docstring | all 11 modules | numpydoc's validator reports no problems (Rubin's usual exemptions; skipped if numpydoc is not installed) |
| `FunctionReferenceTestCase.testFunctionReferenceUpToDate` | The [function reference](function_reference.md) matches the docstrings | `doc/make_function_reference.py` run in memory | the generated page equals `doc/function_reference.md` (skipped if numpydoc is not installed) |
| `LicenceHeaderTestCase.testEverySourceFileHasTheLicenceHeader` | Every source file carries the LSST GPLv3 licence header | all `.py`, `.cc`, `.h`, `.sh` files (except the two `lsst` namespace stubs and the `version.py` that scons writes) | each starts with "This file is part of meas_crowd." and the GPL notice |
| `UnitTestDocTestCase.testUnitTestDocListsEveryTest` | This page is complete | the test methods of every `tests/test_*.py` | every `Class.method` appears on this page |
